## On optionality

A recent Tsinghua result has been framed as a technical breakthrough.

The algorithm itself probably won’t matter to most people.
What stood out to me was the culture signal behind it — a willingness
to try approaches others had already decided would not work.

When I think about long-term options, especially investing, I try not
to write off environments that still reward that kind of experimentation.

You don’t have to be “pro” or “anti” anything.
Just keep good option sets open.
